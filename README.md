# React-Redux Boilerplate Project

This project is a slight variation of the project created from [this](https://medium.com/front-end-developers/handcrafting-an-isomorphic-redux-application-with-love-40ada4468af4#.jkcnpcup6) tutorial, by Milo Mordaunt, as well as the [isomorphic-redux](https://github.com/bananaoomarang/isomorphic-redux) repository.

This is a boilerplate project setup with React, Redux, and Node.js.
